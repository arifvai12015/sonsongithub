WELCOME TO "AMAZING JUMP" Amazing jump photography shoot collection.....i am working California. so You  known for its legendary "jumping frogs of Calaveras County," made popular by author Samuel L. Clemens (also known as Mark Twain), but few people have heard of California's famous "jumping galls." Although they superficially resemble a diminutive version of Mexico's famous "jumping beans," they are really quite different. Both jumping galls and jumping beans move about by the activities of a small, energetic wasp or moth larva inside of them; however, it is the origin of their jumping container that is very different. When WAYNE'S WORD received a sample of jumping galls from northern California, our staff did some investigating, and sure enough, these amazing little galls behave very much like Mexican jumping beans. This remarkable discovery is discussed in an article by F.A. Leach (Natural History Vol. 23, 1923). The minute, globose galls are only 1-1.5 mm in diameter, about the same diameter as the head of an ordinary straight pin. It is easy to see how casual observers could mistake these minute hopping objects for fleas. In fact, we have had so many people curious about the size of these tiny hopping spheres that we have included the following WAYNE'S WORD exclusive comparison of a jumping gall with a human flea (Pulex irritans). Including its extended legs, the flea is slightly larger.
